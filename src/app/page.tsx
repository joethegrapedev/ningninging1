            Hi ning, my previous website failed as you know so i just created another website from scratch HEHEHEHEH. I bet there are easier ways to create websites other than just coding it but why not do this just for fun :D

            Dear Ning xin: <br/>

            <br/>

            Over the past year, ive had the priviledge of working alongside this amazing team that we know as sec. Ive learnt so much about teamwork and about what being a team leader means.
            After all the hard work and effort we put in, we managed to achieve our goals and i am so proud of what we have accomplished. But as you pass your legacy of smile to me, I hope I can carry your vision forward, building smile to be a wonderful community where students can come together and find joy in volunteering.<br/> <br/>
            Throughout this year, there have been many times when you have taken the time to speak to us individually, working with us to make aslc a success, but beyond that you always had that added touch of warmth that a friend brings. From arranging individual meetings with us after starbucks, to calling me after the agm call and giving me pointers, you have always been there for us. <br/>
          </p>
          <p className="text-medium font-sans text-emerald-100">
              I changed the color of the text for absolutely no reason <br /> <br/>
              Anyway as you move into this year without smile, I hope you never stop smilling and never forget that you still have this wonderful group of friends which is SEC :)))). <br/>
              Heres to sending random instagram reels throughout the year and a new year of smile without you. (YIPPEE!!!!!!)  <br/>
            Jiayous in whatever you do and God bless!! :)
